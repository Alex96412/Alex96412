<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex </h1>
I love doing design systems, and I have a lot of projects for the community (as well as the Sass community). Thank you for your sponsorship, which helps support a number of projects I maintain: Clarity, Design Systems Coalition (and its inaugural chapter, the SF Design Systems Coalition), The Mixin, Sass News (3K+ subscribers), running and moderating the Design Systems Slack (20K+ members), the open source design and development work I do for the Sass website, among other art/design/development related projects that will be launched soon.
